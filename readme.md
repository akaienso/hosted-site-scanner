# Hosted Site Scanner

Hosted Site Scanner is a modular Python tool for scanning hosted websites to detect forms, CAPTCHA protection, and other site-level features. Designed for WordPress site hosts and web service providers, this tool helps identify potential spam vectors, enforce security standards, and automate site audits.

## Features

- üîé Automatically crawls websites for pages containing HTML forms
- üõ° Detects CAPTCHA implementations:
  - Google reCAPTCHA (v2/v3)
  - Cloudflare Turnstile
  - hCaptcha
- üóÇ Logs findings to a MySQL database for auditing and reporting
- üîß Modular design for future scanners (e.g., plugin audits, SEO checks, etc.)
- üï∏ Configurable crawler depth and timeout settings
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and easy to deploy

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL or MariaDB
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hosted-site-scanner.git
cd hosted-site-scanner
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

### Configuration

This project reads its database credentials from environment variables. For local development, you can store them in a `.env` file in the project root (ignored by Git).

Example `.env` file:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=hosted_site_scanner

MAX_PAGES=30
TIMEOUT=10
USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; HostedSiteScanner/1.0)
```

> **Note**: The `.env` file is ignored via `.gitignore` and should never be committed.

### Database Setup

Run the following SQL to create necessary tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE websites (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  base_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_scanned DATETIME NULL
);

CREATE TABLE form_scan_results (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  website_id INT NOT NULL,
  page_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  form_count INT NOT NULL,
  captchas_found VARCHAR(255),
  scan_timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (website_id) REFERENCES websites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Usage

Run the scanner:

```bash
python main.py
```

The tool will:

1. Read target sites from the `websites` table.
2. Crawl up to `MAX_PAGES` per site.
3. Log form pages and CAPTCHA presence to `form_scan_results`.

## GitHub Actions (Optional CI)

To enable automatic linting and syntax checks on each push or pull request, create the following workflow file:

**Path:** `.github/workflows/python-lint.yml`

```yaml
name: Python Lint & Syntax Check

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run compile check
        run: |
          python -m compileall .

      - name: Check formatting with black
        run: |
          pip install black
          black --check .

      - name: Run flake8 linting
        run: |
          pip install flake8
          flake8 .
```

This workflow checks for Python syntax errors, enforces code formatting using `black`, and runs `flake8` for PEP8 compliance.
